# What is musicapp?
The main idea behind the Android app is to allow users to make music suggestions which are recieved by a host Android device. Users can vote on each suggested song and the host plays, in order of popularity, each song. For example, everyone at a party uses the app to choose music and build a playlist that everyone likes, the host device then plays each song.
