## Description
\<insert name here\> is a social jukebox application that allows a group of people to collectively contribute to a playlist based off of someone's local music collection on their phone or music streaming service subcriptions they might have (Spotify, Google Play, Xbox Music). Clients will be able to create groups where at any given time one person will be chosen to share their music with everyone else in the group, a majority vote is needed to change who gets to do this. From this person's music everyone in the group will be able to add songs to a queue as well as to remove them. Songs can be up or down voted in the queue giving them priority over other songs. The group will also be able to skip the song that is currently playing if a majority votes on this decision.
